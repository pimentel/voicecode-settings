# voicecode-settings

This is the configuration for Harold Pimentel's VoiceCode.

You will find most of the custom commands in `user/commands.coffee` and `user/terminal.coffee`.

There are also a number of abstract commands defined in `packages/hp_abstract` which are implemented in various program specific files in `user`.

More documentation coming soon...
